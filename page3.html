							<p>The competition for the Miss Universe title has seen many changes, although there have been several constants throughout its history. All the contestants compete in a preliminary round of judging (nowadays called the "Preliminary Competition") where the field is narrowed to a select number of semifinalists. This number has fluctuated over the years. The first Miss Universe pageant had ten semifinalists. For the next two years, the number of semifinalists grew to 16. In 1955, the number dropped to a stable 15, which remained through 1970. In 1971, the number was reduced to 12. That number was further reduced to 10 in 1984. This lasted until 2003, when the contest reinstated the Top 15. This selection continued to be the norm until 2015, except in 2006 and 2011 to 2013. In 2006 and since 2018, there are 20 semifinalists, the highest number of contestants through to the semifinals (and with 2018 currently featuring the most competing contestants overall).</p>

							<p>From 2011 to 2013, there were 16 semifinalists, 15 chosen by judges and one chosen through Internet votes. In the 2016 edition, there were 13 semifinalists - 12 chosen by judges panel from the quarantine to the preliminary night and one chosen by Twitter and Vodi app. In 2017, 16 semifinalists were selected from 4 different groups each hailing from a different region in the world - Africa & Asia-Pacific, Europe, The Americas - and a wild card group (all regions covered). The wild card spots have been in place since 2017. Since 2018, 5 semifinalists are chosen per group and the public vote has been removed. U.S.A.'s Olivia Culpo is the only candidate to have been voted by the public through to the semifinals and eventually win Miss Universe back in 2012, while Jamaica's Davina Bennett and Venezuela's Sthefany Guti√©rrez are the highest-placed wildcard contestants at Miss Universe, eventually finishing as 2nd runners-up in 2017 and 2018, respectively.</p>

							<p>In the early years, the contestants were judged in swimsuit and evening gown only. Since the 1990s, the contestants are now also judged based on their live interviews with their question and answer responses during the coronation night. The crowning moment usually involves the three (or five) remaining finalists. However, since 2015, the climax round for the live pageant is the question and answer portion of the Top 3 remaining contestants. The contestants also competed in a preliminary interview round in a one-on-one meeting with each individual judge, mostly closed-door sessions, as well as in the national costume show in the preliminaries. The live interview round for the semifinalists was dropped as a separate segment with bearing to determine the winner in 2004, and was integrated in the introduction of the semifinalists since 2016.</p>
							<p>The 2018 edition marked the first time that the Miss Universe pageant included the live opening statements after the semifinalists have been announced, to be included in the overall tallies in determining the winner of the competition. The 2019 edition marked the first time ever in Miss Universe pageant's history that the remaining Top 3 contestants are required to deliver their live closing statements, to be included in the overall tallies, right before the announcement of the winner of the competition.</p>
