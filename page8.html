							<strong>The Shocking moment</strong></br>

							<p>And things had been going so smoothly. Steve Harvey had been doing a nice job hosting the 64th annual Miss Universe pageant — the first in 12 years without Donald Trump’s involvement — in a number of flamboyant dinner jackets; sure, Harvey’s jokes were mostly of the “my wife has her eye on me during the swimsuit competition” variety, but it wasn’t, y’know, anything phenomenally, painfully, gut-wrenchingly bad. Until the one moment that truly mattered…</p>

							<p>At the end of the 2015 Miss Universe pageant, host Steve Harvey announced Miss Colombia as the winner, she was crowned and spent about a full minute walking the stage and waving to her adoring new universe of fans. The only problem? Miss Colombia wasn’t the winner of Miss Universe — Miss Philippines, Pia Alonzo Wurtzbach, was the winner written on the card, and Miss Colombia was the first-runner up. Is it too late now for Steve Harvey to say sorry?</p>

							<p>Too late or not, he certainly had to try, live ON THE AIR to correct what was probably the worst mistake in televised pageant history, and while it was a rough moment for almost everyone involved, for those at home, it sent a last-minute jolt of — shall we say — liveliness to an evening that seemed like it would come to a close without much to write home about. But thanks to Harvey’s blunder, plus a few slightly less eye-bugging moments, there’s plenty to say about the 6Miss Universe three-hour event. Let’s get down to the good, the bad, and the Harvey</p>
							<p>As I’ve said, hands-down the No. 1 moment everyone will remember when they think of Miss Universe 2015 — and perhaps the most awkward television moment this year — was when Steve Harvey came out after a full minute of the universe celebrating its new queen, Miss Colombia, to announce that he had made a “horrible mistake” as Miss Colombia stood, still crowned and beaming. “Okay, folks. I have to apologize — the first runner-up is Colombia.” My gut actually clenched…for all parties involved: Miss Colombia who thought she was Miss Universe, Miss Philippines who looked on confusedly from the background, and Steve Harvey, who will surely be haunted by the beautiful, furious faces of these women forever. Harvey said he would “take responsibility for this” and proceeded to show the card that correctly listed Miss Philippines as the 2015 winner of Miss Universe, albeit in a font so small, it’s not hard to imagine that that’s what ol’ Steve was trying to show off.</p>
